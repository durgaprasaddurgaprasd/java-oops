The interfaces we can  create by using interface

example interface i1

every interface can extend the another interface

interface must not be decalred as final because some where we need to make it as implements

the varibales inside the interface always "public static final int a=10";

we can't make the interface varibles are private and protected

 by deafulat it self interfaces are the public static final 

examples about interface varibles are

Interface varibles:

int a;
public static final int a;
static final int a;
final int a;

all are same


Interface Methods:


the interface having the abstract methods and non absatract methods

abstract methods means the methods which are not having body

non abstract methods we can declare in interface in 3 ways only

static type method name();

default type method name();

private type method name();



Notes:

the methods which are static those are not extended by child class those methods 

we need to call directly by the interface name only.

the methods which are default we can call directly by child class it is possible

imp:

the methods which are private if we need to access outside the class those methods are always write in the default method to access 

if we try to put inside the static methods we cant because static can only access the static methods that is the reason only

we cant create the objects for the interfaces but we can use it as a referce for the child methods
